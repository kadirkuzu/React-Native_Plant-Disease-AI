# React Native Plant Disease AI

An AI-powered mobile application developed with **React Native** to detect plant diseases from leaf images.
Users can capture a photo using the camera or upload one from the gallery to identify possible plant diseases.

## Features

- Capture leaf images using the device camera
- Upload images from the gallery
- AI-based plant disease detection
- Android & iOS support
- Simple and fast user interface

---

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**
- **Expo**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **AI / Deep Learning Model Integration**
- **React Navigation**

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadirkuzu/React-Native_Plant-Disease-AI.git
cd React-Native_Plant-Disease-AI
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the project using Expo:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Then run on:

- **Android:** `a`
- **iOS:** `i`
- **Web:** `w`

---

## How It Works

1. Open the application  
2. Capture a plant leaf image or select one from the gallery  
3. The image is sent to the AI model  
4. The model predicts the possible disease  
5. The result is displayed on the screen
